    "question": "What is the Data Protection Act?",
    "answer": "The Data Protection Act (DSG) aims in particular to protect personal data from misuse. One speaks of personal data when these can be assigned to a concrete natural or legal person. For the collection, storage and processing of personal data, either the consent of the persons concerned is usually required or there must be a legal basis. Data processing must be carried out in good faith and must be proportionate. Furthermore, personal data may only be processed for the purpose that was stated when it was collected, is evident from the circumstances or is provided for by law. In the context of websites, data protection law is relevant if personal data is collected, stored and processed when using the websites.In this context, it is particularly important that the data subjects have some form of explicit or at least implicit opportunity to give their consent to data collection, storage and processing, or to refuse such consent.Website operators are recommended to inform their users about what happens to their data.This information usually takes the form of a privacy statement."

    "url": "who-owns-the-copyright",
    "question": "Who owns the copyright?",
    "answer": "Generally, the person who creates a work is the owner of the copyright. Thus, independent artists, photographers and writers own the copyrights to their works. The only exceptions to this rule occur when a work is created by an employee as part of his or her job duties or when a work is created under a written work-for-hire agreement."

    "answer": "Copyright is a form of protection, authorized by the United States Constitution, that gives photographers, artists, authors, musicians, choreographers and architects the exclusive right to use and reproduce their works.

    "url": "how-do-i-get-permission-to-use-a-copyrighted-work",
    "question": "How do I get permission to use a copyrighted work?",
    "answer": "Permission to use a copyrighted work is called a 'license.' A license must be obtained from the owner of the copyright prior to using the work. The license can be oral or written. Obviously, the use of a clearly written licensing agreement will avoid confusion. The writing does not have to be detailed to be effective. A simple letter or invoice is usually sufficient. For example, 'one-time usage rights for photograph in brochure with press run of 5,000 copies and regional newspaper use for six months - $2,500.'"

    "question": "What if a copyrighted work is used without permission?",
    "answer": "The unauthorized use of a copyrighted work is called an infringement. The Copyright Act provides stiff penalties for infringing copyrighted works. Under appropriate circumstances, penalties can include monetary damages, all profits earned by the infringer from the unauthorized use of the copyrighted work and attorneyís fees. A court can also order the destruction of all infringing copies."

    "url": "how-do-i-copyright-my-works",
    "question": "How do I copyright my works?",
    "answer": "A copyright originates at the moment a work is created. For a written work, the copyright comes into existence as the words are typed, printed, or saved to a computer disk. For a photograph, the copyright is created at the moment the image is developed. If a photograph is taken with a modern digital camera, the copyright originates at the time the image is saved on a computer disk or on a hard drive. As long as the work exists in tangible form or can be understood or reproduced with the aid of a machine, it is copyrighted."

    "question": "What is a copyright notation?",
    "answer": "A copyright notation consists of the word 'copyright' or the international copyright symbol, which is the letter 'C' within a circle, together with the year of first publication and the copyright owner's name. For example, a proper copyright notation for this work would be either of the following: c 2008 Andrew D. Epstein or 'Copyright 2008 Andrew D. Epstein.'"

    "question": "If I change a few things in a copyrighted work by adding or taking something away, am I guilty of copyright infringement?",
    "answer": "Yes. The right to make derivative copies is reserved exclusively to the copyright owner. While the idea for a work of art can be copied, the expression of the idea is fully protected. Sometimes, it is difficult to differentiate between an idea and an expression because the idea can sometimes get lost in the expression."

    "question": "Are there any times that I can use a copyrighted work without risking infringement?",
    "answer": "Yes. The concept of fair use permits the utilization of copyrighted materials for certain purposes. For example, a newspaper can publish copyrighted works for purposes of reporting news and a teacher can make multiple copies of certain works for classroom use without risking infringement. In order to determine if a use is fair or is an infringement, one must determine how much of the copyrighted work is used and the impact this use will have on the potential market for the copyrighted work. If large portions of a copyrighted work are used or if the use lessons the potential market for the work, there will be infringement."
